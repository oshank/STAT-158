## 1)

```{r Problem 1}

n <- 30

coefs_age <- rep(0,1e4)

coefs_age2 <- rep(0,1e4)

pvalue <- numeric()
pvalue2 <- numeric()

for (i in 1:1e4) {
  
  Age <- round(runif(n,min=18,max=70))
  
  Age2 <- Age^2
  
  HR <- 94 - Age*0.5 + Age2*0.0035 + rnorm(n,sd=10)
  
  model <- lm(HR~Age+Age2)
  
  coefs_age[i] <- summary(model)$coefficients[2,1]
  
  coefs_age2[i] <- summary(model)$coefficients[3,1]
  
  pvalue[i] <- summary(model)$coefficients[2,4]
  pvalue2[i] <- summary(model)$coefficients[3,4]
  
}

```

#### a)

```{r 1a}

mean(coefs_age)

mean(coefs_age2)

```

These statistics seem correct. As age increases, we see a decline in average heart rates of $0.5$, so it is really close to our model coefficient, $-0.5$, which was stated in the $HR$ Model. The coefficient of age2 should also be really close to our model, which is true, $0.0035$.


#### b)

```{r 1b}

plot(Age, HR, main = "Age vs Heart Rate", ylab = "Heart Rate", xlab = "Age", cex = .8)


```


#### c)

```{r 1c}


```




## 2)

#### a)

```{r Problem 2}


hist(rgamma(10000, 1), breaks = 100)

hist(rgamma(10000, .5), breaks = 100)

hist(rgamma(10000, .1), breaks = 100)


```
As the shape gets smaller, the peak of the data gets closer and closer to 0.


#### b)

```{r 2b}

gamma_1 <- numeric()
gamma_2 <- numeric()


for (i in 1:1000) {
  
  gamma_1[i] <- mean(rgamma(30, 1))
  gamma_2[i] <- mean(rgamma(30, 1))
  
}

t.test(gamma_1,gamma_2)

```
